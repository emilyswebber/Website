### An interdisciplinary adventure

My journey with data began as a neuroscientist. I completed my Ph.D. in an interdisciplinary department that bridged biology, psychology, and philosophy. This is where I first discovered the power of data, statistics, and the art of using numbers to uncover insights.
 
I studied how the brain processes the relative value of rewards by recording from neurons in live, behaving animals. Using 16-channel recordings at 40,000 samples per second, I generated vast amounts of data. Some of this was signal and much of it was noise. The challenge of extracting meaning fascinated me. I taught myself Matlab to separate signal (neural firing) from noise using principal component analysis. I then carried out extensive statistical analyses that revealed important insights into how the brain compares rewards (Webber et al., 2016).

Excited by the interdisciplinary nature of my graduate work, I pursued an interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellowship at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the NIH. There, I studied how the brain generates the feeling of hunger. It was an extraordinary opportunity where I learned cutting-edge techniques, including optogenetics, which uses light to turn neurons on and off.

While at the NIH, I realized that my favorite part of research was working with data. When my fellowship ended, I decided to fully pivot into data science.

&nbsp;

Switching fields was daunting, but I soon found an exciting role as **Assistant Director of Analytics** at the OHSU Foundation. The Foundation was just beginning to apply analytics to philanthropy and needed someone with statistical and modeling expertise to build out the program. I embraced the challenge and helped raise funds for biomedical research. This included supporting work that aimed to end cancer, HIV/AIDS, blindness, and neurodegenerative diseases.

This experience showed me the transformational potential of machine learning. I wanted to dedicate my career to helping others use these tools for impact, which led me to **DataRobot**, an automated machine learning platform designed to **make advanced ML accessible**.

At DataRobot, I learned more than I had during my entire postdoc. I worked with some of the worldâ€™s top data scientists on urgent, real-world problems. Most notably, I supported the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the COVID-19 response, which spanned two White House administrations.

One project I am especially proud of was creating a COVID test exchange program. Using a simple Google Form and R scripts scheduled as cron jobs, I built a system that matched organizations with surplus tests to those in need. The exchange distributed more than **1,000,000 tests**, which showed how simple data-driven solutions can make a major difference.

After COVID, I wanted to return to my roots in human health and joined **Truveta** as **Director of Life Science Research Analytics**. I built a high-performing analytics team that supported life science customers in leveraging EHR data for their research. Following that success, I launched a second team focused on strategic accounts and enterprise partnerships in my current role as **Director of Research Enablement and Development**. In this capacity, I help clients scale the use of EHR data to power their studies and discoveries.  I focus on scaling enablement to all customers with monthly webinars, tutorials, onboardings and workshops. 

**Truveta is unique** in that it is owned and governed by the health systems that contribute to its massive, timely, and representative EHR dataset. Each day, I have the privilege of working with this extraordinary resource and an outstanding team to shed light on what is happening with human health in the United States. I feel fortunate to contribute to this mission and look forward to making an impact for many years to come.
