#### **15+ years of experience empowering learners through teaching, technical training, and scalable enablement.**

*With more than 15 years of experience in teaching and technical enablement, I specialize in designing and scaling programs that help learners translate complex concepts into real-world skills. My background includes developing online courses, creating hands-on labs and certification programs, delivering webinars and workshops, and coaching both technical and non-technical audiences. I am passionate about building engaging, accessible learning experiences that empower people to get the most out of data.*
