  I have extensive public speaking experience.  I have given presentations at both national and international conferences, taught undergraduate courses on research methods, and participated in several interdisciplinary seminars throughout the course of my career.  In my current and prior role I also built out custom enablement materials including courses, videos, articles, and notebooks. Customers use these materials to learn how to achieve their goals with a technical platform. 
  
  I even made an appearance on the nationally televised CBS Sunday Morning Show to demonstrate how lab rats "laugh" when you tickle them.

### Public Outreach

  In addition to my professional pubic speaking, I regularly do outreach events where I engage the community regarding science and professional development.  These include volunteering for STEM in the Park and Brain Awareness Week.

While at OHSU, I volunteered to mentor Postdoctoral Fellows at the Oregon Health and Science University on alternative careers.
